      I started off making Python scripts to increase the productivity at my finance job at PlanMember Services.
      With my obsession for problem-solving, intrigue in design, and my knack for independence my passion for programming quickly grew as I dedicated countless hours after work.<br><br>
      Iâ€™ve spent extensive time fostering my role as a programmer through the fundamentals of web development books, tutorials, and personal projects. Several of my seasoned employers
      also offered me integral training resources and allowed me to take a leading role in the improvement of a crucial website page, improving the UI design, code syntax, and migrating
      the Bootstrap framework from version 3 to 5. I then connected the frontend with the ColdFusion backend before testing and launching it.
      <br><br>
      I am excited to say that I am now work-ready and excited to start programming as a full-time career.
